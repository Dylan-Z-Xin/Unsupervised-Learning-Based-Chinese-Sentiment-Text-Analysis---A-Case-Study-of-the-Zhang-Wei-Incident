# Unsupervised Learning Based Chinese Sentiment Text Analysis - A Case Study of the Zhang Wei Incident

## Project Background

This project is a sentiment analysis of discussions about the Zhang Wei event on social media. The Zhang Wei event is a social incident that has sparked widespread attention and discussion among Chinese netizens, involving phenomena such as online gender conflict, online mimetic environment, and group polarization.

## Method

We used Python to crawl the posts discussing the Zhang Wei event in the Sichuan University bar, and preprocessed the data by deduplication, cleaning, word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and removal of stop words. Then, we used a decision tree-based sentiment classification and an LDA model-based topic analysis to analyze the sentiment and topics of the comment data.

## Results

We successfully conducted a sentiment analysis of the discussions about the Zhang Wei event and identified the main topics of discussion. Our model performed well in the sentiment classification task, accurately identifying the emotional tendencies of the comments. In addition, our topic analysis results also revealed the main issues that netizens focused on when discussing the Zhang Wei event.
